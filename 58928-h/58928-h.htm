<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="COSTUMES" id="COSTUMES"></a>COSTUMES</h2>

<p>The principal garment worn by Japanese ladies is the kimono.
This outer garment or coat is made of silk, generally of a quiet
color ornamented with Japanese designs; or, for general purposes,
of figured calico, turkey red or orange cotton. The back
has no seam and the front is open from top to bottom, sloping
outward below the waist to show the underskirt; the neck is
trimmed V shaped, or faced and turned over to form a collar,
bringing to view a colored kerchief folded across the breast; the
sleeves are loose and end in long, wide, rectangular-shaped bags,
wide open from wrist down and lined. The underskirt, only visible
in front, is of a different color and richly ornamented with
gilt and bright Japanese designs.</p>

<p>To complete the costume, a long, wide sash is passed twice
around the waist and gathered behind into an immense butterfly
bow and ends.</p>

<p>The hair is arranged in pompadour style, and the back hair
brought high up on the top of the head and ornamented with
large, showy pins and little fans.</p>

<p>The eyebrows should be penciled black. Two fine black lines,
one above the upper and one below the lower eyelash, continued
outward, curved slightly upward and meeting just beyond the
outer corner of each eye, give quite a Japanese style to the face.</p>

<p>The little “Moonbeam Fairies” should be costumed in similar
style as to their garments, but of white or different light-colored
material, the sleeves shorter and the sash smaller than in the
ladies’ costumes, and white stockings drawn over their shoes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sakara’s</span> costume should be of sombre hues, the face made up
for a wrinkled old hag.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Cecil</span> is in well-fitting English travelling costume.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Prendergast</span>, the same, but in accordance with her sixty
years. Hair, silver-white.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="FOREWORD" id="FOREWORD"></a>FOREWORD</h2>

<p>The Japanese are notably and effusively polite in their deportment.
Japanese girls are especially kind-hearted and obliging.
Their religion denies them immortality, and they believe that
their paramount duty in life is to please.</p>

<p>Their education imbues them with an intense love of flowers,
bright colors and all that is beautiful; it inculcates the extreme
of social etiquette in every-day deportment; it adds words of
compliment in the commonest phrases of conversation, and, moreover,
teaches them to rely on signs, omens and tutelary gods, both
good and evil.</p>

<p>In this “Romance” the quaint and sprightly style of Japanese
expressions is carried out as faithfully as possible, and the performers
must study carefully the endless obeisances and quaint
dialogue which are indispensable to make it effective.</p>

<p>The scenery, where available, may be elaborate, as in Japanese
operas, but excellent effect may be obtained with a few Japanese
plain and ornamental screens, Japanese umbrellas, fans and
plenty of chrysanthemums, real or artificial, and of various colors.</p>

him at exalted tea-making! He (<span class="sd">rises and comes down <span class="sdp">C.</span>, imitating

O Totmai and O Haru, I thought he would put it all in his
mouth when he opened it, without uttering honorable courtesies,
and drank it all down before His August Majesty had taken more
than a sip! Then his face went just like this. (<span class="sd">Grimaces.</span>)</p>

You know, O Yuki, he has had leave from the all-powerful Son
of Heaven to walk here. O Haru and I played ball, when we
heard (<span class="sd">imitates</span>) stamp&mdash;stamp&mdash;stamp&mdash;and then we saw the
barbarian Englishman come swinging along. Before we had
time to move he nearly walked over us, going like this at a great,
great pipe. (<span class="sd">Walks <span class="sdp">L.</span>, imitating heavy tread of Englishman.</span>)

stranger still was barbarian speech: “By-Jove&mdash;jolly-little

be? Why did that foolish old man leave him the money with
the insane remark about a rightful heiress shipwrecked off the
coast of Japan? Who could find a shipwrecked baby in Japan?
And everything possible has been done. The Lady’s parents were
drowned, and therefore, naturally, with so much water a baby
couldn’t escape. I wonder if Arthur has advertised in the
papers? Do they have newspapers in Japan? Oh, yes, I know;
you begin at the wrong end. Or does he travel about the country

In the morning I will wait for Ito at the gate yonder, but I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>

honorable courtesies, he will draw near, when she touches him,

I would alarm her again, or in deep darkness steal her charm-bag.
What could then protect? (<span class="sd">Ascends summer-house steps,
peers in.</span>) Sakara, the wise woman, wisest in all Japan, will
fight for and protect ancient excellencies of the kingdom. I
plan to make the most exalted Emperor, Son of Heaven, lose his
love for Princess Kiku, child of honorable Prince Yamen.</p>

<p>Can she, foolish one, be truly of sacred royal blood? Could
a Princess of Japan love hated foreigners? (<span class="sd">Clenches hand.</span>)
Barbarian devils! It pleases her to have them at august Court,
and old men growing too old obey the children. The ministers
of State laugh at fears of Sakara (<span class="sd">raises both arms</span>), who fights
for Japan.</p>

pleasant, courteous words, and presents in my hand. There is no

<p><span class="sd"><span class="sds">Miss P.</span></span> I am afraid all these expeditions will be too much
for the young people. I intend looking over my dear boy’s wardrobe&mdash;I
mean his lordship’s wardrobe. (<span class="sd">Crosses <span class="sdp">L.</span></span>) Maitland
is an excellent servant, but I feel anxious about socks. Dear,

etc., draws chair to <span class="sdp">L.</span> of table.</span>) No wonder he has a cold. Dear
me! I would not allow any one to know it for the world, but the
memory of a dear little boy is kept warm in my heart. (<span class="sd">Hands
rest in lap.</span>) What dear, coaxing ways he had&mdash;how I loved the
touch of his arms! Well, they say the heart of a woman at
sixty-nine is the same as that of a young girl. Not (<span class="sd">works
briskly</span>) that I am sixty. Far, far from it! I feel quite positive
that Cecil believes I made this journey, consented to it, merely
for her sake, and I am glad she should believe I faced deadly
perils in order to chaperone her.</p>

<p>Dear me (<span class="sd">hands drop, spectacles fall</span>), it is just two years ago
since that terrible time in London when I found that all my money
was gone&mdash;lost in the failure of that wicked gold-mining company.
I think with shudders of my vulgar landlady and the day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
when I had barely a shilling left. My mid-day repast was a morsel
of bread, a little tea. I was wondering hopelessly&mdash;God forgive
me!&mdash;what to do, where to go. Then, the sudden clamor
in the house, the loud voices (<span class="sd">rises</span>), Arthur, his lordship, burst
into my room. He was excited. He caught hold of me and
hugged me tight, and said, “You wicked old woman, G&mdash;”
(they have always called me G&mdash;since the time Cecil was so
naughty over that letter in the pictorial alphabet. G. stands for
Grannie, and also for goose.) He said, “Go upstairs and put on
your cap or your hat and come away with me. Maitland can
pack your fal-lals. Cecil is waiting, so you must hurry.” I am
afraid&mdash;well, yes, I certainly cried a little. (<span class="sd">Wipes eyes with
socks</span>). Then he pushed me out of the room, and I heard him
talking to the landlady in a very loud voice; she was trembling
afterward. I was so upset that, after all, I carried my bonnet
downstairs and he put it on with his own dear hands, and hugged
me again. We drove off at once to their London house, and
what a happy home they have made it!</p>

<p>They will not hear of my leaving them, though things are not
so bad as I feared. Some of my money was saved, so that I am
not entirely dependent on my dear boy’s bounty. Then I knit all
his socks, the best silk, and he assures me that I save him
pounds; he had always paid 18s. a pair in Regent Street. Iniquitous
robbery!</p>

<p>I do not think I should really mind if I had not a farthing, for
the little one I loved has grown into such a real nobleman.

bows and elaborate politeness try me.</p>

<p><span class="sd"><span class="sds">Cecil</span>.</span> I should have thought you would have revelled in it.
However, here we are, but Arthur is no nearer finding the shipwrecked
baby. Why can’t the foolish boy enjoy the money?
He now intends to lay the whole thing before the Emperor, and
he’ll send a&mdash;what do you call it&mdash;an edict or something through
the land, and all the lost infants will assemble here. Won’t it
be fun? Why, though, G. dear, how stupid of me! She won’t

persisted that the baby was not drowned, but adopted by
kind Japanese. All sorts of inquiries have been made. A great
deal of money comes to her if she can be found, but my brother,
who keeps it if no trace of her can be discovered, would not rest
satisfied until he had visited Japan himself.</p>

<p>A burlesque musical entertainment in 1 act, by W. D. Felter (author of “The Sweet
Family,” etc.), 1 male, 13 female characters. Time of performance about 1½ hours.
This is a miscellaneous programme rendered for the benefit of “The Free Ice Fund
for the Philippine Islanders.” It includes various “specialties,” living pictures,
Mother-Goose chorus, etc., and concludes with a burlesque operetta entitled “<span class="smcap">Johnny
Jones</span>.” The Roses, the Rosebuds and the Only Young Man on the Spot make up
an entertainment that cannot fail to excite continuous mirth for the better part of an
evening. The author has produced this burlesque at church entertainments in many
parts of the country, with unvarying success.</p>

<p>An exceedingly bright piece for young ladies, in which young Dr. Gertrude,
already a victim of circumstances, is made the victim of a practical joke. The scenes
with <i>Mrs. Van Style</i>, who mistakes the doctor for a pawnbroker, and <i>Miss Jane
Simpkins</i>, who brings a sick dog to be cured, are hilarious, while <i><a name="TN3" id="TN3"></a>Norah</i>, an Irish cook,
is deliciously droll. The cook is the star of the piece, but all the personages are
vivacious and every situation bristles with fun.</p>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
